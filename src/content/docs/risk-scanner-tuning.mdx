## Align signals to your threat model

Start with the default catalog, then categorize each signal by:

- **Likelihood** — how often the condition occurs in your environment.
- **Impact** — financial or compliance exposure if ignored.
- **Owner** — team responsible for triage.

Deactivate signals that do not apply (e.g., jurisdiction-specific sanctions) and raise severity for high-impact threats like hot wallet drainage or governance token capture.

## Configure routing rules

Create routing rules that map severity and category to destinations:

- Critical safeguards: PagerDuty + SMS for on-call security lead.
- High: Slack `#splshield-alerts` channel + email summary.
- Medium/Low: Ticket automatically created in your GRC tool with a 24-hour SLA.

```yaml
routes:
  - match:
      severity: critical
    destinations: [pagerduty, sms]
  - match:
      severity: high
    destinations: [slack, email]
  - match:
      severity: [medium, low]
    destinations: [jira]
```

## Review false positives weekly

Run the weekly signal review to keep noise low:

1. Export detections labeled as false positive from the previous seven days.
2. Identify patterns (same counterparty, same wallet) and add to temporary allow-list if risk-approved.
3. Document rationale in the audit log so regulators and partners understand your tuning decisions.

> Keep the false-positive rate under 5%. If it rises above 8%, we recommend reverting to the default baseline and adjusting a single parameter at a time.

## Track improvements

Set OKRs around mean time to acknowledge (MTTA) and mean time to remediate (MTTR). Use the built-in analytics dashboards to monitor progress and share quarterly summaries with leadership.
