## Provision your organization

1. Request onboarding from SPL Shield sales or support and provide a verified corporate email domain.
2. Once your tenant is provisioned, set an administrator passphrase and enable hardware key MFA. Admins are the only role that can manage policies and treasury access by default.
3. Add an on-call recovery contact. This contact receives break-glass notifications if you trigger the emergency halt or policy bypass modes.

## Invite core operating roles

- **Trading Desk** — executes TDL orders and receives enforcement feedback on risky flows.
- **Security Analyst** — tunes the risk scanner, triages alerts, and manages integrations such as SIEM and PagerDuty.
- **Finance Controller** — monitors TDL treasury balances, emission schedules, and settlement reports.

When you invite each teammate, require hardware key verification. Invites expire after 72 hours to minimize stale accounts.

## Mirror sandbox and production policies

Use the environment switcher in the top navigation to hop between sandbox (dev) and production (docs.splshield.com). Keep the following mirrored unless intentionally testing risk scenarios:

- Policy bundles (rate limits, token velocity guards, blocked counterparties).
- Treasury thresholds and insurance fund locks.
- Integrations. If a webhook or SIEM destination should not fire in production, label it clearly in the title.

> Tip: Run the policy diff command-line tool weekly to confirm parity between environments. Include the diff in your compliance evidence folder.

## Run the 30-minute readiness checklist

```shell
npm run policy-audit -- --env production
npm run policy-audit -- --env sandbox
```

Verify that no critical findings are present, that your risk scanner feed is healthy (SLA < 5 minutes), and that all emergency contacts have validated devices. Once complete, you are ready to trade with SPL Shield.
