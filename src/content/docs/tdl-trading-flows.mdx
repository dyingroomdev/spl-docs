## Connect trading venues

Before executing live trades, connect your approved venues (centralized exchange, OTC desk, DEX aggregator):

- Generate API keys with trade-only permissions and store them in the SPL Shield secure vault.
- Map each venue to a counterparty profile so risk scores and sanctions checks align with your compliance rules.
- Run a dry-run order in sandbox to validate that the risk scanner receives the simulated fills.

## Configure trade approvals

| Trade Size (TDL) | Required Approvers | SLA |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --- |
| &lt; 10,000        | Trading Desk        | Immediate |
| 10,000–100,000   | Trading Desk + Finance Controller | 15 minutes |
| &gt; 100,000       | All roles           | 30 minutes |

Use the approval matrix in SPL Shield to codify the thresholds. When a trade exceeds the configured limits, SPL Shield pauses execution until sign-off is complete.

## Monitor liquidity and slippage

The liquidity dashboard surfaces venue depth, historical slippage, and on-chain settlement health. Set alerts for:

- Spread widening beyond 2.5% compared to VWAP.
- Settlement delays longer than 15 minutes.
- Counterparty concentration above 35% of daily volume.

## Automate post-trade reporting

```json
{
  "report": "tdl-trade",
  "frequency": "daily",
  "destinations": [
    "s3://splshield-reports/compliance",
    "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX"
  ],
  "metrics": ["venue_volume", "slippage", "counterparty_risk"]
}
```

Schedule the post-trade report with the above payload via the reporting API. Analysts receive a summary in Slack and the full dataset lands in your compliance storage bucket.
